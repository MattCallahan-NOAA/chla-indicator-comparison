"1","AMJ_Chlorophylla_Biomass_SEBS_Satellite","April-June average chlorophyll-a biomass within the north middle shelf of the EBS; calculated with 8-day composite data from MODIS satellites aggregated by BSIERP region","2022"
"2","Spring_Chlorophylla_Biomass_EGOA_Satellite","Derived chlorophyll a concentration data during spring seasonal peak (May) in the eastern GOA were obtained from the 4km Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) version 4.0 monthly gridded dataset, European Space Agency available online at http://www.esa-oceancolour-cci.org. The data were downloaded from NOAA CoastWatch-West Coast Regional Node and Southwest Fisheries Science Center's Environment Research Division.

Gridded data were filtered for the month of May and averaged across the month and across all EGOA data with a depth range from 10m - 200m. Code available at: https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators","2019"
"3","Spring_Chlorophylla_Biomass_SEBS_Inner_Shelf_Satellite","Chlorophyll a biomass was calculated as the April-June average chlorophyll-a estimates from MODIS satellites within the Southern Inner Shelf of the Bering Sea.

Code available at: https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators/blob/main/ESP_Chlorophyll_Crab.R","2020"
"4","Spring_Chlorophylla_Biomass_SEBS_Satellite","Derived chlorophyll a concentration during spring seasonal peak (May) in the southeastern Bering Sea were obtained from MODIS satellite sensor at a 4x4 km resolution and aggregated 8-day composite. Peak timing of the spring bloom was calculated for individual ADF&G statistical areas in the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) region (Nielson et al., 2020). Peak timing was then averaged across all statistical areas in order to weight each stat area equally. This is to avoid giving inner shelf areas more weight since the chlorophyll a biomass is higher in those areas during the peak. Data available from 2003 to present.","2019"
"5","Spring_Chlorophylla_Biomass_SMBKC_Satellite","Chlorophyll a Biomass: April-June average chlorophyll-a biomass within the St. Matthew region of the Bering Sea; calculated with 8-day composite data from MODIS satellites.

"6","Spring_Chlorophylla_Biomass_WCGOA_Satellite","Derived chlorophyll a concentration data during spring seasonal peak (May) in the western and central GOA were obtained from the 4km Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) version 4.0 monthly gridded dataset, European Space Agency available online at http://www.esa-oceancolour-cci.org. The data were downloaded from NOAA CoastWatch-West Coast Regional Node and Southwest Fisheries Science Center's Environment Research Division.

Gridded data were filtered for the month of May and averaged across the month and across all WCGOA data with a depth range from 10m - 200m. Code available at: https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators","2019"
"7","Spring_Chlorophylla_Peak_EGOA_Satellite","Derived chlorophyll a concentration during spring seasonal peak (May) in the eastern GOA were obtained from MODIS satellite sensor at a 4x4 km resolution and aggregated 8-day composite. Peak timing of the spring bloom was calculated for the eastern GOA (EGOA) region (Watson et al., 2020) for NMFS areas 640 and 650, federal waters from 10m-200m depth.

"9","Spring_Chlorophylla_Peak_WCGOA_Satellite","Derived chlorophyll a concentration during spring seasonal peak (May) in the western and central (combined) GOA were obtained from MODIS satellite sensor at a 4x4 km resolution and aggregated 8-day composite. Peak timing of the spring bloom was calculated for the western and central GOA (WCGOA) region (Watson et al., 2020). The data are served through the ERDDAP maintained by NOAA CoastWatch West Coast Regional Node and Southwest Fisheries Science Center's Environment Research Division. Data available from 2003 to present.
